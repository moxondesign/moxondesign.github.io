  <h2>About Moxon&#8203; Design</h2>
	<P>
         Moxon Design was established in 1983 to assist companies engaged
         in electronic product design. Since that time, we have worked
         on a variety of products, for both the consumer and professional
         markets. We specialize in complex electronic systems, including embedded control systems,
		 and high density, integrated circuit design.
		 We have years of experience with applications in 
		 process control, motor control, computer graphics, digital video, digital audio, 
		 vector processing (high performance computing), and telecommunications.
	</P>
	<P>
		 Most recently, we have been working on the integration of 
		 Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools on the Internet.
         We can bring world-class design practices and methodologies to your
		 hardware and software development teams,
		 with a commitment to integrity and customer service.
		 Bridging the gap between the world wide web and the corporate intranet,
		 with techniques for long distance collaboration and concurrent global engineering.

         Moxon Design is an international consulting firm, and we have
         successfully completed projects from London, England to Seoul, Korea.
